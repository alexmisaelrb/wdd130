    <p>
        Hi, my name is Alexis Ronderos, but most people call me "Misa" because my middle name.
    </p>    
    <p>
        I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Applied Technology oriented to Software Development.
    </p>    
    <p>
        I love dancing salsa, and in my spare time as a hobby,
        I teach free classes in the Church since I have always considered that the gifts we have are to be shared..
    </p>    
    <p>
        I'm single, I feel confident to go and look for an eternal companion this year 
    </p>    
    <p>
        I currently work as an IT recruiter. It's a job that I like but doesn't love, but I work hard to 
        achieve my goals and strive to work in the area that most attracts my attention
        my main personal goal for this year is to obtain my first Software Development certificate 
        to work in application development to help the community..
    </p>    
    <p>
        Before working as an IT recruiter, I had in mind to study psychology, however, working in the HR 
        department as an IT recruiter made me fall in love with software development while seeing what 
        people could create by coding. I studied computer science in high school which gave me a programming 
        background but it never caught my attention until now that I see it in detail
    </p>      
    <p>
        This year I celebrate 8 years as a member of the Church, and it has been the decision that helped 
        me to become the man I am now.
        I have a personal saying: If there is a problem that can be solved, why bother? And if the problem has 
        no solution, why bother?
        However, thanks to the Atonement of Jesus Christ, even death has a solution, so there's any need to 
        get worried about anything.
